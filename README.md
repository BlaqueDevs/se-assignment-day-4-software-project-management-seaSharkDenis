## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope clarifies:
- The project's objectives.
- The specific results that will be delivered.
- What functionalities the software will have.
- The limitations that exists in terms of budget, timeline, resources, or technology.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierachical map of the project. It breaks down the entire project into smaller, manageable tasks:
- Level 1: Project Deliverables: The main components of the project e.g design, development, testing
- Level 2: Sub-Deliverables: Breakdown of each deliverable into smaller tasks e.g design user interface, develop backend logic, performing unit tests
- Level 3: Work Packages: Further breakdown of taks into specific activities e.g creation of wireframes, writing code for a specific feature, e.t.c
  Why is WBS useful:
- Organization: WBS provides a structured overview of the project, making it easier to manage and tracks progress.
- Task allocation: Helps assign taks to specific team members based on their skills and expertise.
- Resource planning: Allowing for accurate estimation of resources needed for each tasks.
- Time management: Provides a basis for creating a project schedule and tracking deadlines.
- Cost control: Facilitates budgeting and cost tracking for each task.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a detailed project schedule:
- Clear visibility: A schedule provides a clear picture of all project tasks, their dependencies, and deadlines.
- Improved time management: By breaking down a project into manageable tasks and assigning deadlines, you can track progress and identify potential delays early on.
